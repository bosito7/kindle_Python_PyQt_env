There are a number of examples shipped in the python-qt4-doc package. In order
to run them, you will need to copy them from
/usr/share/doc/python-qt4-doc/examples to a location where you have write
priviledges.  After copying them, you can excecute demos/qtdemo/qtdemo.py and
it will provide a graphical mechanism to run the various demos.
